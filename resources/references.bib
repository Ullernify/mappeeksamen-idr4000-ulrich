               training prescription (RTx) variables (load, sets and frequency)
               affect muscle strength and hypertrophy. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE,
               Embase, Emcare, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Web of Science were
               searched until February 2022. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised
               trials that included healthy adults, compared at least 2
               predefined conditions (non-exercise control (CTRL) and 12 RTx,
               differentiated by load, sets and/or weekly frequency), and
               reported muscle strength and/or hypertrophy were included.
               ANALYSES: Systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis
               methodology was used to compare RTxs and CTRL. Surface under the
               cumulative ranking curve values were used to rank conditions.
               Confidence was assessed with threshold analysis. RESULTS: The
               strength network included 178 studies (n=5097; women=45\%). The
               hypertrophy network included 119 studies (n=3364; women=47\%).
               All RTxs were superior to CTRL for muscle strength and
               hypertrophy. Higher-load (>80\% of single repetition maximum)
               prescriptions maximised strength gains, and all prescriptions
               comparably promoted muscle hypertrophy. While the calculated
               effects of many prescriptions were similar, higher-load,
               multiset, thrice-weekly training (standardised mean difference
               (95\% credible interval); 1.60 (1.38 to 1.82) vs CTRL) was the
               highest-ranked RTx for strength, and higher-load, multiset,
               twice-weekly training (0.66 (0.47 to 0.85) vs CTRL) was the
               highest-ranked RTx for hypertrophy. Threshold analysis
               demonstrated these results were extremely robust. CONCLUSION:
               All RTx promoted strength and hypertrophy compared with no
               exercise. The highest-ranked prescriptions for strength involved
               higher loads, whereas the highest-ranked prescriptions for

  abstract = "In order to stimulate further adaptation toward specific training
              goals, progressive resistance training (RT) protocols are
              necessary. The optimal characteristics of strength-specific
              programs include the use of concentric (CON), eccentric (ECC),
              and isometric muscle actions and the performance of bilateral and
              unilateral single- and multiple-joint exercises. In addition, it
              is recommended that strength programs sequence exercises to
              optimize the preservation of exercise intensity (large before
              small muscle group exercises, multiple-joint exercises before
              single-joint exercises, and higher-intensity before
              lower-intensity exercises). For novice (untrained individuals
              with no RT experience or who have not trained for several years)
              training, it is recommended that loads correspond to a repetition
              range of an 8-12 repetition maximum (RM). For intermediate
              (individuals with approximately 6 months of consistent RT
              experience) to advanced (individuals with years of RT experience)
              training, it is recommended that individuals use a wider loading
              range from 1 to 12 RM in a periodized fashion with eventual
              emphasis on heavy loading (1-6 RM) using 3- to 5-min rest periods
              between sets performed at a moderate contraction velocity (1-2 s
              CON; 1-2 s ECC). When training at a specific RM load, it is
              recommended that 2-10\% increase in load be applied when the
              individual can perform the current workload for one to two
              repetitions over the desired number. The recommendation for
              training frequency is 2-3 d x wk(-1) for novice training, 3-4 d x
              wk(-1) for intermediate training, and 4-5 d x wk(-1) for advanced
              training. Similar program designs are recommended for hypertrophy
              training with respect to exercise selection and frequency. For
              loading, it is recommended that loads corresponding to 1-12 RM be
              used in periodized fashion with emphasis on the 6-12 RM zone
              using 1- to 2-min rest periods between sets at a moderate
              velocity. Higher volume, multiple-set programs are recommended
              for maximizing hypertrophy. Progression in power training entails
              two general loading strategies: 1) strength training and 2) use
              of light loads (0-60\% of 1 RM for lower body exercises; 30-60\%
              of 1 RM for upper body exercises) performed at a fast contraction
              velocity with 3-5 min of rest between sets for multiple sets per
              exercise (three to five sets). It is also recommended that
              emphasis be placed on multiple-joint exercises especially those
              involving the total body. For local muscular endurance training,
              it is recommended that light to moderate loads (40-60\% of 1 RM)
              be performed for high repetitions (>15) using short rest periods
              (<90 s). In the interpretation of this position stand as with
              prior ones, recommendations should be applied in context and
              should be contingent upon an individual's target goals, physical
              capacity, and training status.",

               use hierarchical, random-effects meta-regression to compare the
               effects of single and multiple sets per exercise on dynamic
               strength. English-language studies comparing single with
               multiple sets per exercise, while controlling for other
               variables, were considered eligible for inclusion. The analysis
               comprised 92 effect sizes (ESs) nested within 30 treatment
               groups and 14 studies. Multiple sets were associated with a
               larger ES than a single set (difference = 0.26 +/- 0.05;
               confidence interval [CI]: 0.15, 0.37; p < 0.0001). In a
               dose-response model, 2 to 3 sets per exercise were associated

               Here, we aimed to test whether the same was true with acute
               exercise-mediated changes in muscle protein synthesis. Eighteen
               men (21 $\pm$ 1 yr, 22.6 $\pm$ 2.1 kg/m(2); means $\pm$ SE) had

               leg with their assigned regime for a period of 10 wk, 3
               times/wk. We made pre- and posttraining measures of strength,

               and posttraining biopsies of the vastus lateralis, and a single
               postexercise (1 h) biopsy following the first bout of exercise,
               to measure signaling proteins. Training-induced increases in

               training-induced isometric strength gains were significant but
