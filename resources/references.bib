  abstract  = "Internal validity refers to the degree of control exerted over
               potential confounding variables to reduce alternative
               explanations for the effects of various treatments. In exercise
               and sports-science research and routine testing, internal
               validity is commonly achieved by controlling variables such as
               exercise and warm-up protocols, prior training, nutritional
               intake before testing, ambient temperature, time of testing,
               hours of sleep, age, and gender. However, a number of other
               potential confounding variables often do not receive adequate
               attention in sports physiology and performance research. These
               confounding variables include instructions on how to perform the
               test, volume and frequency of verbal encouragement, knowledge of
               exercise endpoint, number and gender of observers in the room,
               influence of music played before and during testing, and the
               effects of mental fatigue on performance. In this review the

@article{Hopkins2000,
  title     = "Measures of reliability in sports medicine and science",
  author    = "Hopkins, W G",
  abstract  = "Reliability refers to the reproducibility of values of a test,
               assay or other measurement in repeated trials on the same
               individuals. Better reliability implies better precision of
               single measurements and better tracking of changes in
               measurements in research or practical settings. The main
               measures of reliability are within-subject random variation,
               systematic change in the mean, and retest correlation. A simple,
               adaptable form of within-subject variation is the typical
               (standard) error of measurement: the standard deviation of an
               individual's repeated measurements. For many measurements in
               sports medicine and science, the typical error is best expressed
               as a coefficient of variation (percentage of the mean). A
               biased, more limited form of within-subject variation is the
               limits of agreement: the 95\% likely range of change of an
               individual's measurements between 2 trials. Systematic changes
               in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent
               such effects as learning, motivation or fatigue; these changes
               need to be eliminated from estimates of within-subject
               variation. Retest correlation is difficult to interpret, mainly
               because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the
               sample of participants. Uses of reliability include
               decision-making when monitoring individuals, comparison of tests
               or equipment, estimation of sample size in experiments and
               estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the
               response to a treatment. Reasonable precision for estimates of
               reliability requires approximately 50 study participants and at
               least 3 trials. Studies aimed at assessing variation in
               reliability between tests or equipment require complex designs
               and analyses that researchers seldom perform correctly. A wider
               understanding of reliability and adoption of the typical error
               as the standard measure of reliability would improve the
               assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplines.",

              different high-intensity training (HIT) models, balanced for
              total load but differing in training plan progression, on
              endurance adaptations. METHODS: Sixty-three cyclists (peak oxygen
              uptake (V˙O2peak) 61.3 $\pm$ 5.8 mL·kg·min) were randomized to
              three training groups and instructed to follow a 12-wk training
              program consisting of 24 interval sessions, a high volume of
              low-intensity training, and laboratory testing. The increasing
              HIT group (n = 23) performed interval training as 4 $\times$ 16
              min in weeks 1-4, 4 $\times$ 8 min in weeks 5-8, and 4 $\times$ 4
              min in weeks 9-12. The decreasing HIT group (n = 20) performed
              interval sessions in the opposite mesocycle order as the
              increasing HIT group, and the mixed HIT group (n = 20) performed
              the interval prescriptions in a mixed distribution in all
              mesocycles. Interval sessions were prescribed as maximal session
              efforts and executed at mean values 4.7, 9.2, and 12.7 mmol·L
              blood lactate in 4 $\times$ 16-, 4 $\times$ 8-, and 4 $\times$
              4-min sessions, respectively (P 0.05). Further, an individual
              response analysis indicated similar likelihood of large,
              moderate, or nonresponses, respectively, in response to each
              training group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that
              organizing different interval sessions in a specific periodized
              mesocycle order or in a mixed distribution during a 12-wk
              training period has little or no effect on training adaptation
              when the overall training load is the same.",

              (RT). College-aged resistance-trained males (training age = 5
              $\pm$ 3 years; mean $\pm$ SD) performed 6 weeks of RT wherein
              frequency was 3 d/week and each session involved 2 upper- and 2
              lower-body exercises (10 repetitions/set). Volume increased from
              10 sets/exercise (week 1) to 32 sets/exercise (week 6), which is
              the highest volume investigated in this timeframe. Participants
              were assigned to WP (25 g/d; n = 10), MALTO (30 g/d; n = 10), or
              GWP (25-150 g/d from weeks 1-6; n = 11), and supplementation
              occurred throughout training. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
              (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL), and biceps brachii ultrasounds for
              muscle thicknesses, and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy
              (BIS) were performed prior to training (PRE) and after weeks 3
              (MID) and 6 (POST). VL biopsies were also collected for
              immunohistochemical staining. The GWP group experienced the
              greatest PRE to POST reduction in DXA fat mass (FM) (-1.00 kg, p
              < 0.05), and a robust increase in DXA fat- and bone-free mass
              [termed lean body mass (LBM) throughout] (+2.93 kg, p < 0.05).
              However, the MALTO group also experienced a PRE to POST increase
              in DXA LBM (+2.35 kg, p < 0.05), and the GWP and MALTO groups
              experienced similar PRE to POST increases in type II muscle fiber
              cross-sectional area (~+300 $\mu$m2). When examining the effects
              of training on LBM increases ($\Delta$LBM) in all participants
              combined, PRE to MID (+1.34 kg, p < 0.001) and MID to POST (+0.85
              kg, p < 0.001) increases were observed. However, when adjusting
              $\Delta$LBM for extracellular water (ECW) changes, intending to
              remove the confounder of edema, a significant increase was
              observed from PRE to MID (+1.18 kg, p < 0.001) but not MID to
              POST (+0.25 kg; p = 0.131). Based upon DXA data, GWP
              supplementation may be a viable strategy to improve body
              composition during high-volume RT. However, large LBM increases
              observed in the MALTO group preclude us from suggesting that GWP
              supplementation is clearly superior in facilitating skeletal
              muscle hypertrophy. With regard to the implemented RT program,
              ECW-corrected $\Delta$LBM gains were largely dampened, but still
              positive, in resistance-trained participants when RT exceeded ~20

               30 participants. PRE-to-W6 HIGH and LOW responders exhibited a
               composite hypertrophy change of +10.7 $\pm$ 3.2 and -2.1 $\pm$
               1.6\%, respectively (p W3 > PRE), phospho (p)-4EBP1 (PRE >

               proteins (PRE > W6), mechano growth factor mRNA (W6 > W3\&PRE),
               45S rRNA (PRE > W6), and muscle citrate synthase activity (PRE >
               W3\&W6). No interactions existed for the aforementioned
               biomarkers and/or other assayed targets (muscle 20S proteasome
               activity, serum total testosterone, muscle androgen receptor
               protein levels, muscle glycogen, or serum creatine kinase).
               Regression analysis indicated PRE type II fiber percentage (R 2

               change in the composite hypertrophy score. While our sample size

               investigated the effect of block training periodization on
               maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and parameters of exercise
               performance in elite junior alpine skiers. Six female and 15
               male athletes were assigned to high-intensity interval (IT, N =
               13) or control training groups (CT, N = 8). IT performed 15
               high-intensity aerobic interval (HIT) sessions in 11 days.
               Sessions were 4 x 4 min at 90-95\% of maximal heart rate
               separated by 3-min recovery periods. CT continued their
               conventionally mixed training, containing endurance and strength
               sessions. Before and 7 days after training, subjects performed a
               ramp incremental test followed by a high-intensity
               time-to-exhaustion (tlim) test both on a cycle ergometer, a 90-s
               high-box jump test as well as countermovement (CMJ) and squat
               jumps (SJ) on a force plate. IT significantly improved relative
               VO2max by 6.0\% (P < 0.01; male +7.5\%, female +2.1\%), relative
               peak power output by 5.5\% (P < 0.01) and power output at
               ventilatory threshold 2 by 9.6\% (P < 0.01). No changes occurred
               for these measures in CT. tlim remained unchanged in both
               groups. High-box jump performance was significantly improved in
               males of IT only (4.9\%, P < 0.05). Jump peak power (CMJ -4.8\%,
               SJ -4.1\%; P < 0.01), but not height decreased in IT only. For
               competitive alpine skiers, block periodization of HIT offers a
               promising way to efficiently improve VO2max and performance.

  abstract  = "CONTEXT: The purpose of study, experimental, or research design
               in scientific manuscripts has changed significantly over the
               years. It has evolved from an explanation of the design of the
               experiment (ie, data gathering or acquisition) to an explanation
               of the statistical analysis. This practice makes ``Methods''
               sections hard to read and understand. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the
               difference between study design and statistical analysis, to
               show the advantages of a properly written study design on
               article comprehension, and to encourage authors to correctly
               describe study designs. DESCRIPTION: The role of study design is
               explored from the introduction of the concept by Fisher through
               modern-day scientists and the AMA Manual of Style. At one time,
               when experiments were simpler, the study design and statistical
               design were identical or very similar. With the complex research
               that is common today, which often includes manipulating
               variables to create new variables and the multiple (and
               different) analyses of a single data set, data collection is
               very different than statistical design. Thus, both a study
               design and a statistical design are necessary. ADVANTAGES:
               Scientific manuscripts will be much easier to read and
               comprehend. A proper experimental design serves as a road map to
               the study methods, helping readers to understand more clearly
               how the data were obtained and, therefore, assisting them in
               properly analyzing the results.",

               and statistical analysis of sport performance research, rather
               than to supply an authoritative 'cookbook' of methods. In
               general, we try to communicate some possible solutions to the
               conundrum of how to maintain both internal and external
               validity, as well as optimize statistical power, in applied
               sport performance research. We start by arguing that some sport
               performance research has been overly concerned with
               physiological predictors of performance, at the expense of not
               providing a valid and reliable description of the exact nature
               of the task in question. We show how the influence of certain
               factors on competitive performances can be described using
               linear or logistic regression. We discuss the choice of analysis
               for factorial repeated-measures designs, which is complicated by
               the assumption of 'sphericity' in a univariate general linear
               model, and the relatively low statistical power of the
               multivariate approach when used with small samples. We consider
               a little-used and simpler technique known as 'analysis of
               summary statistics'. In multi-group pre- and post-test designs,
               a useful technique can be to pair-match individuals on their
               performance scores in a counterbalanced fashion before the
               intervention or control has been introduced. Finally, we outline
               how confidence intervals can help in making statements about the
               probability of the population difference in performance
               exceeding the value designated as being worthwhile or not.",

  title     = "Measures of reliability in sports medicine and science",
  author    = "Hopkins, W G",
  abstract  = "Reliability refers to the reproducibility of values of a test,
               assay or other measurement in repeated trials on the same
               individuals. Better reliability implies better precision of
               single measurements and better tracking of changes in
               measurements in research or practical settings. The main
               measures of reliability are within-subject random variation,
               systematic change in the mean, and retest correlation. A simple,
               adaptable form of within-subject variation is the typical
               (standard) error of measurement: the standard deviation of an
               individual's repeated measurements. For many measurements in
               sports medicine and science, the typical error is best expressed
               as a coefficient of variation (percentage of the mean). A
               biased, more limited form of within-subject variation is the
               limits of agreement: the 95\% likely range of change of an
               individual's measurements between 2 trials. Systematic changes
               in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent
               such effects as learning, motivation or fatigue; these changes
               need to be eliminated from estimates of within-subject
               variation. Retest correlation is difficult to interpret, mainly
               because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the
               sample of participants. Uses of reliability include
               decision-making when monitoring individuals, comparison of tests
               or equipment, estimation of sample size in experiments and
               estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the
               response to a treatment. Reasonable precision for estimates of
               reliability requires approximately 50 study participants and at
               least 3 trials. Studies aimed at assessing variation in
               reliability between tests or equipment require complex designs
               and analyses that researchers seldom perform correctly. A wider
               understanding of reliability and adoption of the typical error
               as the standard measure of reliability would improve the
               assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplines.",

               trainability of VO2max. To address this topic we analyzed IT and
               IT/CT studies published in English from 1965-2012. Inclusion
               criteria were: 1)$\geq$ 3 healthy sedentary/recreationally
               active humans <45 yrs old, 2) training duration 6-13 weeks, 3)
               $\geq$ 3 days/week, 4) $\geq$ 10 minutes of high intensity work,
               5) $\geq$ 1:1 work/rest ratio, and 6) results reported as mean
               $\pm$ SD or SE, ranges of change, or individual data. Due to
               heterogeneity (I(2) value of 70), statistical synthesis of the
               data used a random effects model. The summary statistic of
               interest was the change in VO2max. A total of 334 subjects (120
               women) from 37 studies were identified. Participants were
               grouped into 40 distinct training groups, so the unit of
               analysis was 40 rather than 37. An increase in VO2max of 0.51 L
               · min(-1) (95\% CI: 0.43 to 0.60 L · min(-1)) was observed. A
               subset of 9 studies, with 72 subjects, that featured longer
               intervals showed even larger (~0.8-0.9 L · min(-1)) changes in
               VO2max with evidence of a marked response in all subjects. These
               results suggest that ideas about trainability and VO2max should
               be further evaluated with standardized IT or IT/CT training
               programs.",

               Embase, Emcare, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Web of Science were
               searched until February 2022. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised
               trials that included healthy adults, compared at least 2
               predefined conditions (non-exercise control (CTRL) and 12 RTx,
               differentiated by load, sets and/or weekly frequency), and
               reported muscle strength and/or hypertrophy were included.
               ANALYSES: Systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis
               methodology was used to compare RTxs and CTRL. Surface under the
               cumulative ranking curve values were used to rank conditions.
               Confidence was assessed with threshold analysis. RESULTS: The
               strength network included 178 studies (n=5097; women=45\%). The
               hypertrophy network included 119 studies (n=3364; women=47\%).
               All RTxs were superior to CTRL for muscle strength and
               hypertrophy. Higher-load (>80\% of single repetition maximum)
               prescriptions maximised strength gains, and all prescriptions
               comparably promoted muscle hypertrophy. While the calculated
               effects of many prescriptions were similar, higher-load,
               multiset, thrice-weekly training (standardised mean difference
               (95\% credible interval); 1.60 (1.38 to 1.82) vs CTRL) was the
               highest-ranked RTx for strength, and higher-load, multiset,
               twice-weekly training (0.66 (0.47 to 0.85) vs CTRL) was the
               highest-ranked RTx for hypertrophy. Threshold analysis

               All RTx promoted strength and hypertrophy compared with no

  abstract = "In order to stimulate further adaptation toward specific training
              goals, progressive resistance training (RT) protocols are
              necessary. The optimal characteristics of strength-specific
              programs include the use of concentric (CON), eccentric (ECC),
              and isometric muscle actions and the performance of bilateral and
              unilateral single- and multiple-joint exercises. In addition, it
              is recommended that strength programs sequence exercises to
              optimize the preservation of exercise intensity (large before
              small muscle group exercises, multiple-joint exercises before
              single-joint exercises, and higher-intensity before
              lower-intensity exercises). For novice (untrained individuals
              with no RT experience or who have not trained for several years)
              training, it is recommended that loads correspond to a repetition
              range of an 8-12 repetition maximum (RM). For intermediate
              (individuals with approximately 6 months of consistent RT
              experience) to advanced (individuals with years of RT experience)
              training, it is recommended that individuals use a wider loading
              range from 1 to 12 RM in a periodized fashion with eventual
              emphasis on heavy loading (1-6 RM) using 3- to 5-min rest periods
              between sets performed at a moderate contraction velocity (1-2 s
              CON; 1-2 s ECC). When training at a specific RM load, it is
              recommended that 2-10\% increase in load be applied when the
              individual can perform the current workload for one to two
              repetitions over the desired number. The recommendation for
              training frequency is 2-3 d x wk(-1) for novice training, 3-4 d x
              wk(-1) for intermediate training, and 4-5 d x wk(-1) for advanced
              training. Similar program designs are recommended for hypertrophy
              training with respect to exercise selection and frequency. For
              loading, it is recommended that loads corresponding to 1-12 RM be
              used in periodized fashion with emphasis on the 6-12 RM zone
              using 1- to 2-min rest periods between sets at a moderate
              velocity. Higher volume, multiple-set programs are recommended
              for maximizing hypertrophy. Progression in power training entails
              two general loading strategies: 1) strength training and 2) use
              of light loads (0-60\% of 1 RM for lower body exercises; 30-60\%
              of 1 RM for upper body exercises) performed at a fast contraction
              velocity with 3-5 min of rest between sets for multiple sets per
              exercise (three to five sets). It is also recommended that
              emphasis be placed on multiple-joint exercises especially those
              involving the total body. For local muscular endurance training,
              it is recommended that light to moderate loads (40-60\% of 1 RM)
              be performed for high repetitions (>15) using short rest periods
              (<90 s). In the interpretation of this position stand as with
              prior ones, recommendations should be applied in context and
              should be contingent upon an individual's target goals, physical
              capacity, and training status.",

               strength. English-language studies comparing single with
               multiple sets per exercise, while controlling for other
               variables, were considered eligible for inclusion. The analysis
               comprised 92 effect sizes (ESs) nested within 30 treatment
               groups and 14 studies. Multiple sets were associated with a
               larger ES than a single set (difference = 0.26 +/- 0.05;
               confidence interval [CI]: 0.15, 0.37; p < 0.0001). In a

               cardiovascular hospitalization and overall mortality in these
               group of patients. Objectives: This study was conducted to
               evaluate the iron status in non-dialysis CKD patients. Methods:
               This cross-sectional study was carried out in the Department of
               Biochemistry, Dhaka medical college, Dhaka from the period of
               July 2018 to June 2019. In this study, thirty non-dialysis CKD
               patients were taken from the Department of Nephrology, Dhaka
               Medical College Hospital, Dhaka. For better assessment another
               age and sex matched thirty healthy individuals were also taken.
               Hemoglobin, serum creatinine, iron, total iron binding capacity
               (TIBC), transferrin saturation (TSAT) and ferritin levels of all
               participants were measured and all values were analyzed
               statistically. Results: Mean age of the non-dialysis CKD
               patients was 48.07 $\pm$ 12.42 years in this study. All of them
               were anemic with hemoglobin concentration",

  abstract  = "The two most commonly used methods to analyze data from
               real-time, quantitative PCR experiments are absolute
               quantification and relative quantification. Absolute
               quantification determines the input copy number, usually by
               relating the PCR signal to a standard curve. Relative
               quantification relates the PCR signal of the target transcript
               in a treatment group to that of another sample such as an
               untreated control. The 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method is a
               convenient way to analyze the relative changes in gene
               expression from real-time quantitative PCR experiments. The
               purpose of this report is to present the derivation,
               assumptions, and applications of the 2(-Delta Delta C(T))
               method. In addition, we present the derivation and applications
               of two variations of the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method that may be
               useful in the analysis of real-time, quantitative PCR data.",

  abstract  = "During resistance training the muscle undergoes many changes.
               Possibly the most profound and significant changes are those
               that occur in the muscles contractile proteins. Increases in
               these contractile proteins are one of the primary factors
               contributing to myofibrillar hypertrophy. The most abundant
               muscle protein is myosin, which comprises 25\% of the total
               muscle protein. Due to the large amount of skeletal muscle that
               is composed of myosin, changes in this fiber may have profound
               effects on skeletal muscle size and strength. The myosin
               molecule is made up of 6 subunits, 2 very large heavy chains,
               and 4 smaller light chains. The myosin heavy chain (MHC)
               accounts for 25-30\% of all muscle proteins making its size an
               important factor in skeletal muscle growth. In conjunction with
               resistance training, dietary protein intake must be adequate to
               illicit positive adaptations. Although many studies have
               evaluated the role of dietary protein intake on skeletal muscle
               changes, few have evaluated the MHC specifically. Research has
               clearly defined the need for dietary protein and resistance
               training to facilitate positive changes in skeletal muscle. The
               purpose of this review was to evaluate the current literature on
               the effects of dietary protein and resistance training on the
               expression of the myosin heavy chain.",

  author    = "Pette, D and Staron, R S",
  abstract  = "Skeletal muscle is an extremely heterogeneous tissue composed of
               a variety of fast and slow fiber types and subtypes. Moreover,
               muscle fibers are versatile entities capable of adjusting their
               phenotypic properties in response to altered functional demands.
               Major differences between muscle fiber types relate to their
               myosin complement, i.e., isoforms of myosin light and heavy
               chains. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms appear to represent
               the most appropriate markers for fiber type delineation. On this
               basis, pure fiber types are characterized by the expression of a
               single MHC isoform, whereas hybrid fiber type express two or
               more MHC isoforms. Hybrid fibers bridge the gap between the pure
               fiber types. The fiber population of skeletal muscles, thus,
               encompasses a continuum of pure and hybrid fiber types. Under
               certain conditions, changes can be induced in MHC isoform
               expression heading in the direction of either fast-to-slow or
               slow-to-fast. Increased neuromuscular activity, mechanical
               loading, and hypothyroidism are conditions that induce
               fast-to-slow transitions, whereas reduced neuromuscular
               activity, mechanical unloading, and hyperthyroidism cause
               transitions in the slow-to-fast direction.",
